# 2048 AI
This is a algorithm, written in Python, which plays the game [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)). It reaches the 2048 tile about 60% of the time and 1024 tile nearly 100% of the time.

The algorithm is based on the [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) algorithm. At each move, the algorithm performs a number of simulations, each of which is a random game of 2048. The algorithm then selects the move that has the best score.
